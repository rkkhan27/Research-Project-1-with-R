## Improving Voting Turnout

Laws regarding the conditions of voting are being actively debated and changing right now in the US. Voter
turnout rates in the US are often low by international standards. Many policies and interventions have been
considered to increase voter turnout such as making voting day a national holiday (so work does not keep
people from voting) or making mail-in ballots much more widely accessible. Other policies being discussed
or passed may further decrease voter turnout while some claim they will decrease voter fraud (voter fraud
is a topic in the US where misinformation has been common).

Some of these interventions have been tested and there is empirical evidence on how successful they are.
In this homework, we will be considering data from a 2006 randomized experiment where people in a large
US city were randomly assigned to a control group that received no treatment (usual voting conditions)
or to a treatment group that received a letter telling them that their neighbors would be informed about
whether or not they voted (the social psychologists call this a ‘social pressure intervention’). 

You may
find out more about this study in the paper “Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large
Scale Field Experiment” DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S000305540808009X. The researchers then recorded
whether each potential voter voted in the 2006 primary election.
